I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the Khoury College of Computer Sciences, Northeastern University, advised by [Prof. Kevin Fu](https://kevinfu.com/). Before that I received my master's degree from the Shandong University, working under the guidance of [Prof. Pengfei Hu](https://perfecthu.github.io/). I completed my B.E. degree at Shandong Normal University under the supervision of Prof. Hong Wang.

My research interests primarily focus on the Cyber Physical System Security, exploring potential vulnerabilities and privacy leakage risks in sensors through side-channel analysis. My goal is to enhance the security and privacy of Cyber Physical Systems.
